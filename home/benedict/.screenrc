# Some notes on the string there
# First, set foreground and background to black
# This is a work around for a bug whereby screen changed
# the order in which the colours are read, but not in all cases.
# When you have one tab open, it reads fg,bg. However, as in the docs
# in other cases it reads bg,fg.
# Thankfully, if only one is specified, it's assumed as fg.
# Status line shows: host, this window, list of other windows, clock
